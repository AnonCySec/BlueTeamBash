# BlueTeamBash
I this repo I wrote a few basic Bash scripts for beginners who are interested in learning Bash scripting for defensive security. This should help you develop your Blue Team bash skills along with thinking outside the box.

# Log Checker
Usage: sudo ./log_checker.sh
This script will check the /var/log directory for log files indicating a potential unwanted login to your system.

# Log Size Monitor
Usage: sudo ./log_size_monitor.sh
This script will monitor the size of the logfiles, if a log file exceeds the maximum allowed size it will generate an alert indicating a potential attack or incident.
